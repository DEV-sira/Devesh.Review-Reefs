                        <h1>50 Reefs Initiative</h1>

                        <p>
                            The 50 Reefs initiative was conceived by The Ocean
                            Agency during the filming of the Netflix Original
                            Documentary Chasing Coral. It was developed in
                            partnership with the Global Change Institute at The
                            University of Queensland and the Wildlife
                            Conservation Society and funded by Bloomberg
                            Philanthropies, The Tiffany & Co. Foundation and
                            Paul G. Allen Philanthropies. The initiative had the
                            ambitious goal of identifying a global portfolio of
                            coral reefs with a good chance of both surviving the
                            impacts of climate change and being able to help
                            repopulate neighboring reefs. Working with some of
                            the world’s top coral reef scientists, the study
                            actually identified a greater number of reefs than
                            had originally been anticipated. The study has
                            resulted in over $93m in funding for the reefs
                            identified and is used by the Global Fund for Coral
                            Reefs to target investments.
