                            <h2>1.1. What Are Marine Guidelines?</h2>

                            <p>
                                Marine guidelines are a set of principles and
                                rules established to govern activities in marine
                                environments. These guidelines are designed to
                                promote sustainable practices, safeguard
                                biodiversity, and mitigate the impact of human
                                activities on the oceans. They cover a wide
                                range of topics, from fishing practices to the
                                establishment and management of marine protected
                                areas.
                            </p>

                            <h2>1.2. Types of Marine Guidelines</h2>

                            <p>
                                Marine guidelines come in various forms, each
                                serving a unique purpose. These include
                                guidelines for sustainable fishing,
                                conservation, marine spatial planning, and more.
                                Guidelines are developed at local, national, and
                                international levels, reflecting the diverse
                                marine ecosystems they aim to protect.
                            </p>

                            <h2>1.3. The Role of Marine Guidelines</h2>

                            <p>
                                The primary role of marine guidelines is to
                                foster responsible and sustainable marine
                                practices. They provide a framework for
                                decision-making and action, ensuring that human
                                activities in marine environments are in harmony
                                with the health of these ecosystems. By adhering
                                to these guidelines, we can safeguard marine
                                biodiversity and protect these vital resources.
